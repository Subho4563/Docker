1. What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source centralized platform designed to create, deploy and run applications.
Docker uses a container on the host O.S to run apps. It allows apps to use the same Linux kernel as a system on the host computer, rather than creating a whole virtual O.S.

2. Advantages of Docker?
No pre-allocation of RAM.
light in weight and less cost.
It can run on physical hardware, virtual hardware and on the cloud.
You can reuse the image.

3. Docker Ecosystem:

Docker Daemon/Engine
Docker Daemon runs on the host O.S. It is responsible for running containers to manage docker services.
Docker Daemon can communicate with other Daemons. It is a Background process.

Docker Client:
Docker users can interact with the docker daemon through a client. [CLI]
Docker Client uses commands and rest API to communicate with Docker Daemon.

Docker Host:
It is used to provide an environment to execute and run applications. It contains the docker daemon, images, containers, networks and storage.

Docker Hub/Registry:
Docker Hub manages and stores the docker images.
There are two types of registries in the docker.
Public - called Docker Hub
Private - use to share images within the enterprise.

Docker Images:
Docker Images are the read-only binary templates used to create docker containers.

Ways to create :

Take image from Docker Hub
Create an image from the Docker file
Create Images from existing Docker Containers.

Docker Container:

A container holds the entire package that is needed to run the application.
The container is like a Virtual Machine, Images become containers when they run on the docker engine.

5. Docker Commands:
First update system:
sudo apt-get update

Install Docker:
sudo apt-get install docker.io

To check Docker status:
systemctl status docker

Add Docker to the group to use it:
sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER

To see the active container list:
docker ps

To see all containers list (not active as well):
docker ps -a

To run an image as a container:
docker run -it --name<container name> <image name> /bin/bash

To see all images in Docker:
docker images

To start/stop Container.
docker start <container name>

docker stop <container name>
To go inside a container.

docker attach <container name>
To check service started or not.

service docker status
To delete containers.

docker rm <container name>
To check the stats of a container, the memory consumed

docker stats


To build MySQL image:
docker pull mysql -----> it will pull image from docker-hub
docker run -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=test@123 mysql:latest----> to run the image as a container.
docker ps -----> to see it in the container list
docker exec -it <conatiner id> bash -----> to execute MySQL and use it
mysql -u root -p -------> add password
